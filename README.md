<h1 style="color: black">Where the idea came from.</h1>
Growing up I never liked school and was always a dreamer. I wasn't stupid, however wasn't suited to the in person environment of school, where you only had the opportunity to grasp a topic once. I would spend my days perpetually bored. Points Lab is intended to be the solution to this problem, because it replicates the solution that I found, however further enhances this tactic that proved very effective in my own leaving cert.

<h1 style="font-color: black">Self Teaching</h1>
I began trying to teach maths in September of 2022, and saw the effects almost instantly. In January of 2023 I began teaching myself all of my six school subjects and it was the best decision I had ever made at that point. I had a much more hands on approach than I had in school. Here is a graph of my results over that time period.
